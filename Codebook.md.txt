Introduction

The script run_analysis.R performs the 5 steps described below:

1. All the similar data is merged using the rbind() function. By similar, we address those files having the same number of columns and referring to the same entities.
2. Only those columns with the mean and standard deviation measures are taken from the whole dataset. After extracting these columns, they are given the correct names, taken from features.txt.
3. Activity data is addressed with values 1:6, we take the activity names and IDs from activity_labels.txt and they are substituted in the dataset.
4. On the whole dataset, those columns with vague column names are corrected.
5. Finally, we generate a new dataset with all the average measures for each subject and activity type (30 subjects * 6 activities = 180 rows). The output file is called tidy.txt, and uploaded to this repository.



Variables

1. train, trainActivities,trainSubjects, test, testActivities, testSubject  contain the data from the downloaded files.

2. train and test data are merged to allData for further analysis.

3. Subject and activity are the identifiers.

4. The output summerizes in a text file named tidy.txt .This dataset has averages of each variable for each activity and each subject.

R packages : plyar, rshape2

Activity Labels

1.WALKING (value 1): subject was walking during the test
2.WALKING_UPSTAIRS (value 2): subject was walking up a staircase during the test
3.WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS (value 3): subject was walking down a staircase during the test
4.SITTING (value 4): subject was sitting during the test
5.STANDING(value 5): subject was standing during the test
6.LAYING (value 6): subject was laying down during the test
